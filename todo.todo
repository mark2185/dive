✔ stable sort of a tree @done (2023-12-01 11:26)
☐ help menu as popup
☐ image details as a separate tab
☐ copy attributes (hash, name, tags)

Later down the line:
☐ stream image tar maybe?
☐ not crash when the image is too big to fit in ram, instead store it on disk and then stream it?
☐ open selected file
☐ aggregate changes
☐ change the width of the last column in a table
☐ layer details viewport wrap text
